        <h3>M: Peer-Gynt, rolls and actors</h3>
        <img src="/public/img/mlang1_page.webp" alt="First sequence of the movie M">
        <p>M is a German film directed by Fritz Lang in 1931. It is his first talking film (still in black and white). </p>
        <p>The plot of this film is inspired by the case of Peter Kürten, in the 20's, a German serial killer and rapist from Düsseldorf, this story tells how a city will track down and how far it is willing to go to stop a pedophile and serial killer of children.</p>
        <h5>Peer-Gynt</h5>
        <p>A music comes back often in the film, it is notably whistled. </p>
        <p>This last one is very famous and comes from the play Peer Gynt realized in 1874 by a Norwegian, Edvard Grieg. </p>
        <img src="/public/img/mlang2_page.webp" alt="A scene of the movie M">
        <p>This music is entitled "In the den of the king of the mountain" and is similar to the moment when the hero Peer Gynt, a young man in search of love and adventure.</p>
        <p>Having fled his village, he finds himself in an environment full of gnomes, trolls and other monsters typical of Nordic mythology</p>
        <h5>Raids of the Lost Roll</h5>
        <p>At the time of Fritz Lang, the films were on reels and at its release, M measured 3208 meters for a duration of 117 minutes, unfortunately parts were lost. </p>
        <p>This version was, moreover, censored in 1934 by the Nazis.</p>
        <img src="/public/img/mlang3_page.webp" alt="Photo of the film crew during a scene from M le Maudit">
        <p>After the war, only 2693 meters remained, but this version was released in the cinema.</p>
        <p>It was not until 2001 that a restored version of 108 minutes was released. We then find, a little bit apart, parts of the film and after reassembly, a definitive version of 3024 m for 105 minutes comes out but after many problems of image format.</p>
        <p>It is finally in 2011 that a version of 111 minutes appears with the help of French copies.</p>
        <h5>Who are these actors?</h5>
        <p>M being the first talking film of Fritz Lang, he had to surround himself well to find actors who could play and express themselves at the same time. </p>
        <img src="/public/img/mlang4_page.webp" alt="Scene from M le maudit, where the protagonist is facing the mob">
        <p>He found actors from the theater, including Peter Lorre (the villain of the film).</p>
        <p>This film allowed him to launch his career and, when he left the National Socialist German to the United States, he already had a reputation that allowed him to turn in many films including "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by Alfred Hitchcock in 1934.</p>
        <p>At the end of M, during the judgement scene, Lang asked real inmates who had been released from prison for the occasion to play in his film to embody the underworld.</p>
