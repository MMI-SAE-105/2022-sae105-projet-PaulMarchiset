        <h3>Amsterdam : bikes, Satan and screaming</h3>
        <img src="/public/img/amsterdam1_page.webp" alt="Amsterdam canal and boats">
        <p>Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands with a population of 850,000 inhabitants and a surface area of 219.3 km2 located in the Amsterdam region in the northwest of the Netherlands.</p>
        <h5>More bikes than inhabitants?</h5>
        <p>We know that Amsterdam is the city of bikes, that there are even more bikes than inhabitants, but do you know why?</p>
        <p>In the 60's, cars were the progress: they were present everywhere in the city, all the roads had to be redesigned (enlarged), destroying houses. Moreover, it caused the death of many children.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s, the people of <a href="glossaire.html">Amstelloden</a> wanted to do away with cars, so they opposed the city council's pro-car plans and got back on their bikes as before.</p>

        <h5>The Church of Satan in the red-light district</h5>
        <p>Amsterdam is known as a city of freedom and tolerance, but with certain limits.</p>
        <p>60's in the red-light district, everybody knows each other. The district is a construction of a young man: <a href="glossaire.html">Maarten Lamers</a>. He builds his business (of sex...) trying to pass it off as a religious institution (including a monastic order), in this case Satanist, to avoid paying taxes.</p>
        <p>His business is doing well, very well, and Lamers must therefore be fully in his role as a satanic high priest.</p>
        <img src="/public/img/amsterdam3_page.webp" alt="red light district in Amsterdam">
        <p>Unfortunately for him, the tax and customs authorities realized that something was going on behind his back. And 14 years later, the Satanic Church of Lamers was raided on a massive scale.</p>
        <p>The judge finally sentenced Lamers to one year in prison for tax evasion with tax refunds to the IRS.</p>
        <h5>Screaming in the XIVe century </h5>
        <p>Cows bellowing in the slaughterhouse next to you, and ten children running on a thin wooden floor above you. This kind of noise pollution was once quite normal.</p>
        <p>With the invention of the flue, homes could accommodate occupants on each floor, which could cause a lot of noise, even though shoes were removed when entering the home.</p>
        <p>On top of that, the residents were treated to the daily sounds of animals being shot in the street.</p>
        <img src="/public/img/amsterdam4_page.webp" alt="city center of Amsterdam in the XVIth century">
        <p>Finally, although the city had only 30,000 inhabitants at the time, many inns existed (often located under the houses)</p>
        <p>To solve these problems of noise pollution, during the day, you could go to a monastery to rest.</p>
